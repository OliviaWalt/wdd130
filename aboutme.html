                Hi, My name is Olivia Walton and I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I am unsure of my Major but love to try a lot of different activities. I like doing any form of art, rock climbing, writing, reading, music, math, and more. I am a math tutor in the BYU-I Math Study Center and have loved teaching there. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to understand Web Design to help me understand how computers work. This will also help as I look forward, and work on, selling my art  by giving me the skills to create my own page the way I want.
