        <p>Glennwood Canyon is a beautiful place filled with steep cliffs that tower above, and rushing blue water below. However, that is not all this canyon has to offer. Close to the fork in the canyon where the town of Glenwood Springs sits, you will find small springs escpaing into the river along the canyon edges. If you look above in this same area, you will find the ride of the amusement park above on the mountain, hanging over the egde, exciting its passengers.  </p>
        <p>As you go through this scenic canyon, you will find steadfast rock walls on either side protecting the train tracks and highway below from the wind and weather. In this canyon sits a train track thqt rides alongside the river, a train passing intermittantly. The highway snakes its way through right beside, sometimes overlapping it's self in its mechanicle wonder through ther tight walls. Despite the recent fires through the area, this is a wonderufl time to visit due to the new growth and plant life filling the canyon.</p>
        <p>Come scheduale a time to travel with us and see this gorgus canyon yourself!</p>
